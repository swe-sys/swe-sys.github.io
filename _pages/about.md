Hey there! I am a Ph.D. scholar at ARMS Lab, studying systems and control engineering at IIT Bombay. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Leena Vachhani, who has been instrumental in shaping my research journey. My primary research interest lies in the fascinating world of swarm robotics and swarm intelligence, exploring how collective behavior can lead to incredible outcomes in autonomous systems. I am always on the lookout for collaboration opportunities to work with like-minded individuals who share the same passion for robotics and AI. If you are interested in working together, feel free to drop me a line, and let's connect!
